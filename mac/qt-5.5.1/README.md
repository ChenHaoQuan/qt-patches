Building Qt-5.5.1 x64 on OS X 10.11
===================================

This version of Qt might be interresting since it's the last one
to have QtWebKit.

Get the source code tarball, decompress it and rename the directory:

    > tar -zxf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.5.1.tar.gz
    > mv qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.5.1 qt-src-5.5.1

Apply the patch. It fixes a compile error with Apple's latest SDK and
also fix a bug when using Objective-C souce code with precompiled
headers and generating an Xcode project (something I need).

    > cd  qt-src-5.5.1
	> patch -p1 < ../qt-patches/mac/qt-5.5.1/qt-5.5.1-mac.patch
	> cd ..

I do a shadow build, that is, build out of the source tree, so make a
directory where to build and configure. I also reset the PATH
to a sane value so that things like MacPorts don't interfere with the
build.

This is the configuration I use and know to work, you might
have some luck with something different, but some do fail. Youâ€™re on
your own if you do it differently. Also, not all examples build,
so I disable them.

Openssl has been deprecated for a while on Mac OS X and the
OS X 10.11 SDK does not ship with the openssl headers anymore. Therefor,
openssl support will be disabled by default when you compile with
Xcode 7. I have worked around that by providing the openssl headers of
an older Mac OS X SDK. This will still work since openssl itself, the
librairies, are still part of Mac OS X.

This configuration build qt with 'libc++', the c++11 library.

    > mkdir qt-build-5.5.1
    > cd qt-build-5.5.1
    > export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
    > ../qt-src-5.5.1/configure -debug-and-release -nomake examples -prefix /usr/local/Qt-5.5.1 -openssl -I "$PWD/../qt-patches/mac_openssl_include"

Build and install.

    > make -j3
    > sudo make install

Done!

If you need the documentation installed as well:

    > make generate_docs
    > make qch_docs
    > sudo make install_qch_docs

Tested with Xcode 7.2.1 on Mac OS X 10.11
