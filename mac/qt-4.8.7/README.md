Building Qt-4.8.7 x64 on OS X 10.11 with Xcode
==============================================

Get the source code tarball, decompress it and rename the directory:

    > tar -zxf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.7.tar.gz
    > mv qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.7 qt-src-4.8.7

Apply the patch. It fixes a compile error with Apple's latest SDK and
also fix a bug when using Objective-C souce code with precompiled
headers and generating an Xcode project (something I need).

    > cd  qt-src-4.8.7
	> patch -p1 < ../qt-patches/mac/qt-4.8.7/qt-4.8.7-mac.patch
	> cd ..

I do a shadow build, that is, build out of the source tree, so make a
directory where to build and configure. I also reset the PATH
to a sane value so that things like MacPorts don't interfere with the
build.

This is the configuration I use and know to work, you might
have some luck with something different, but some do fail. Youâ€™re on
your own if you do it differently. Also, not all examples build,
so I disable them.

Openssl has been deprecated for a while on Mac OS X and the
OS X 10.11 SDK does not ship with the openssl headers anymore. Therefor,
openssl support will be disabled by default when you compile with
Xcode 7. I have worked around that by providing the openssl headers of
an older Mac OS X SDK. This will still work since openssl itself, the
librairies, are still part of Mac OS X.

This configuration will build qt with 'libstdc++', the c++03 library,
so no access to c++11 library features. You can add
'-platform unsupported/macx-clang-libc++' to the configure line to build
with 'libc++' instead and have access to c++11 library features, but you
won't be able to deploy on Mac OS X 10.6.

    > mkdir qt-build-4.8.7
    > cd qt-build-4.8.7
    > export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
    > ../qt-src-4.8.7/configure -debug-and-release -nomake examples -no-qt3support -prefix /usr/local/Qt-4.8.7 -arch x86_64 -openssl -I "$PWD/../qt-patches/mac_openssl_include"

Build and install.

    > make -j3
    > sudo make install

Done!

Tested with Xcode 7.2.1 on Mac OS X 10.11
